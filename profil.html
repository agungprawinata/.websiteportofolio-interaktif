                   <p><b><span class="h2">Introduction</span></b><br>The word technology generally refers to the basic implementation of facts used for the development and innovation of new devices and tools which play an important role in almost all fields. This is how we carry out scientific innovation and integrate & use it for our own purposes. Today, it is an umbrella word denoting a myriad of tools, machines and tools. Today, it is a generic word denoting various senses, machines, and tools. All of these senses are created by humans to make tasks faster, easier, comfortable & more comfortable. Even though technology has gone very far in making life more comfortable for each of us, technology has also brought a lot of negative effects that we cannot ignore.
                       <br><b><span class="h2">Advantages of Technology</span></b><br>
                       If we reveal how old technology is, then we can receive a lot of answers. But I want to reveal technology is as old as life itself. We have always had many forms of technology, as a result of which it is very difficult for us to demonstrate concurrent and perfect technological innovation at every point of our civilization.
                       <br><b><span class="h2">Addiction of technology</span></b><br>
                   Due to advancement and rapid growth of technology it is fine to improve our life and the process of living. However, there is too rapid increase in the addiction level of technology and this addiction can be very dangerous and disastrous. .
                       <br><b><span class="h2">Disadvantages of technology</span></b><br>
                       Although we receive poly benefits based on technology, we also face poly problems through it. The first and worst condition faced using technology is pollution. Due to the drastic increase in pollution of our environment, we are facing new diseases, world warming & depletion of various power sources. Valuable resources are in the extinction phase. We accept temperatures that are too high in the dominant expression of heat and too low in the dominant expression of cold due to the warming of the world caused by the technology. Because of the hyperbole entertainment that technology provides to our daily lives, people don't go out and enjoy nature.                   
                       <br><b><span class="h2">Conclusion</span></b><br>
                   We can tell technology to be very addictive as a result of its convenience and the easy comfort sources with much better entertainment that it offers. It is however important that a person try to find a balance between nature and technology and not get too much of technology. If one can be able to do this, it is sure that oneâ€™s life will be changed for a better and one would be able to live a happy and free of stress-free life.
